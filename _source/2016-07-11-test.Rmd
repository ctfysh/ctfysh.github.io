```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Math

You can write inline formula like this $$x^2+y^2=r^2$$ and displayed formula like

$$\begin{cases}
X_{i}=\sum_{i=1}^{h}w_{i}^{\prime}/\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}^{\prime}\\
Y_{i}=\sum_{i=1}^{h}x_{i}^{\prime}/\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{\prime}
\end{cases}$$
